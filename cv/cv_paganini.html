		<p>
			I've been working with computers since 1984. As a curious and
			open minded person, I'm naturally drawn to positions requiring a
			substantial knowledge and involvement with computers. My assignments
			so far included system and BIOS level programming, Systems
			Administration (HP-UX, Unix and Linux), network, and database
			administration (Oracle). My current position, as a Technical
			Manager for NDS Americas (a News Corp company), allows me to employ all these skills to
			solve complex problems in a realtime digital TV broadcasting and
			access-control system for Sky Latin America.
		</p>
		<p>
			I have over 8 years of experience in Unix/Linux
			administration (HP-UX, SCO, ISC Unix and various flavours of Linux), as well
			as networking (TCP/IP, Cisco Routers, Switches and firewalls). I am very
			comfortable with Unix in general, and in particular with the Linux operating
			system, which I've been using as my desktop operating system for the last six years.
		</p>
		<p>
			I'm also conversant with most technologies and protocols that make up
			the Internet, having offered consultancy services to Internet Service
			Providers between 1996 and 1999. At that time, I helped design,
			install, configure, secure, and manage most aspects of various ISPs, including
			Web Servers, Mail Servers, News Servers, DNS, Routers, Terminal Servers and
			Firewalls.
		</p>
		<p>
			I'm proficient in many programming and markup languages, including C, ASMx86,
			Shell Scripting, Perl 5, Python and HTML. I authored two open source projects: "Angel",
			a simplistic Network Monitor written in Perl and "ASK", a challenge-response
			anti-spam solution written in Python, for which I wrote a paper published in the
			FREENIX track of the 2003 Annual Usenix Conference.
