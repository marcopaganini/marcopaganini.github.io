<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>
A challenging position as a Technical Manager or Senior Systems Administrator in an
environment requiring a diverse array of technical skills.
<p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
I've been working with computers since 1984. As a curious and open minded
person, I'm naturally drawn to positions requiring a substantial knowledge and
involvement with computers. My assignments so far included system and BIOS
level programming, Systems Administration (HP-UX, Unix and Linux), network, and
database administration (Oracle). My current position, as a Technical Manager
for NDS Americas (a News Corp company), allows me to employ all these skills to
solve complex problems in a realtime digital TV broadcasting and access-control
system for Sky Latin America.
<p>
I have over 8 years of experience in Unix/Linux administration (HP-UX, SCO, ISC
Unix and various flavours of Linux), as well as networking (TCP/IP, Cisco
Routers, Switches and firewalls). I am very comfortable with Unix in general,
and in particular with the Linux operating system, which I've been using as my
desktop operating system for the last six years.
<p>
I'm also conversant with most technologies and protocols that make up the
Internet, having offered consultancy services to Internet Service Providers
between 1996 and 1999. At that time, I helped design, install, configure,
secure, and manage most aspects of various ISPs, including Web Servers, Mail
Servers, News Servers, DNS, Routers, Terminal Servers and Firewalls.
<p>
I'm proficient in many programming and markup languages, including C, ASMx86,
Shell Scripting, Perl 5, Python and HTML. I authored two open source projects:
"Angel", a simplistic Network Monitor written in Perl and "ASK", a
challenge-response anti-spam solution written in Python, for which I wrote a
paper published in the FREENIX track of the 2003 Annual Usenix Conference.
<p>
