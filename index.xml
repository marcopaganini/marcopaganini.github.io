      <description>Solo Mojave &amp;amp; Death Valley trip 2015 With two weeks of vacation my hands, I decided that a week-long visit to the desert was in order. Since I was alone, this was mostly a &amp;ldquo;leisure&amp;rdquo; trip, with short hikes over known spots. Also, unlike the previous trips where we had an RV, this time decided to stay in a local hotel and do day trips, coming back at night after some cooling off watching the stars.</description>
